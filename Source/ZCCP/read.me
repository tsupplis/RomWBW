ZCCP has been improved slightly from the original release. It 
should run much the same as before however modifications have 
been made in an attempt to allow it to work successfully from 
systems which boot from other than the A: drive. Also, the 
terminal dimensions are now automatically taken from the SCB (as 
set up by GENCPM). Special thanks go to Randy Winchester who is 
sharing his easy to follow instructions about ZCCP. Read ZCCP.TXT 
in this package for the expert help.




ZCCP Quick Instructions
=======================

ZCCP is a direct replacement for the CP/M 3.0 CCP. It requires 
ZPM3 and provides a ZCPR compatible system. There are some minor 
incompatibilities with ZCPR however the advantages of ZCCP more 
than outweigh these.

You must replace your current CCP with the ZCCP.COM. How you do 
this will depend on the setup of your computer so no details are 
given here.

When ZCCP starts, it reads ZINSTAL.ZPM (which must be on the 
default boot drive (usually A:) in user area 0). This file can 
be patched to set initial values for MHZ (speed of the computer), 
MAXU (maximum user number) and MAXD (highest disk drive). These 
values are set near the start of the ZINSTAL.ZPM file and there 
are ASCII pointers to them (which can be seen with a debugger 
such as SID.COM).

After ZINSTAL.ZPM has been read, ZCCP attempts to run the command 
STARTZPM.COM. This is usually an "alias" containing a number of 
commands used to put the system into a useful state. Typically 
STARTZPM.COM would contain commands to load a TCAP and named 
directory file, to set the path, and to set an error handler.

LOADSEG.COM is a ZCCP utility used to load RSXes, TCAPs and Named 
Directory files. It contains some online help.

RSXDIR.COM is a ZCPR utility which displays RSXes in memory. It 
has been included to help you understand how LOADSEG places 
various segments in high memory.

DISKINFO.COM is a ZCPR utility which gives information about your 
disks. It has been included for your interest.

Note that ZCCP has very few resident commands. If you are 
switching from a standard CP/M 3.0 CCP you will find that you are 
unable to perform certain simple functions (such as directory 
displays!). You should therefore obtain replacements for the CCP 
resident commands before installing ZCCP. The Z-Node bulletin 
boards in Australia and the USA are a good source. Note that ZCCP 
will not load Type-4 ZCPR programs.

If you are familiar with ZCPR systems you should have little 
trouble in getting the most from ZCCP. If you are new to ZCPR, I 
suggest that you learn as much as you can. ZCPR is a complex and 
powerful system which does very little without proper setup.

RCP's and IOP's are not implemented (which saves TPA space) and 
FCP's are not implemented although flow control is. To use flow 
control you must have an IF.COM program to handle IF commands. 
ZCCP handles the standard flow control commands internally (XIF, 
FI, ELSE, AND, OR). There are two other internal commands 
implemented: NOTE (a do-nothing command) and CLS (to clear the 
screen).


The ZCCP package presented here may be freely distributed and 
used for your own private use. No commercial or institutional use 
is allowed without prior written agreement.


The ZCCP package is copyright 1992,1993 by Simeon Cran, Brisbane, 
Australia.


The Z-Node 62 BBS in Perth, Western Australia may be contacted 
from Australia on 09 450 0200 or from overseas on +619 4500200. 
Z-Node 62 also is a distribution point for ZPM3 and MYZ80. MYZ80 
is a high performance Z80 emulator for IBM AT (and better) 
computers. MYZ80 is able to run ZPM3.


No support for ZCCP is being offered at this stage. Use at your 
own risk.
