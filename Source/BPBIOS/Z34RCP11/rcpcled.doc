RCPCLED - Command Line Editing and History Shell for Z34RCP11
Author:   Rob Friefeld
Version:  1.3
Date:     October 2, 1989

Command: CLED
Syntax:  CLED [/]
          If "/", run once only (e.g. from a shell such as ZFILER)

Features:

     CLED is a memory resident command line editor which extends the minimal 
features of the CCP to include cursor movement, insert/delete, and 
record/recall of command lines.  Though part of the RCP, CLED is also a ZCPR 
"shell" which automatically reinvokes itself following any ZCPR command.  It 
thus uses up one shell stack entry (normally there are four, which is plenty). 
If a ZS/ZDDOS, DateStamper, or Z3PLUS clock is implemented, the command prompt 
shows the system time.  To disable time display under Z3PLUS (if you have no 
clock), set the system date to 01/01/78.

     The default control key set includes these important commands:

      CR - execute command line
   ESC Q - pop the shell
   ESC S - toggle recording on/off  (prompt shows >/>> to indicate state)
      ^W - recall command lines from history stack
      ^E - recall history in reverse direction


Installation:

     The installation program, CLEDINST, allows you to set up the editor
to your preference.  The RCP can be installed directly in memory or in a disk 
file -- RCPxxx.ZRL or a system configuration saved with SNAP or NZBLITZ.  
CLEDINST also serves as a "help" utility by displaying the current command 
bindings.  Type "CLEDINST //" for help with CLEDINST.COM.


History Tool:

     CLEDSAVE writes the contents of the history stack to a text file on disk.
The file can be reloaded later (CLEDSAVE <file> L), or composed in advance 
with a text editor, then loaded.  If the file is too large for the history 
stack, as many commmand lines as fit are loaded.

     CLEDSAVE is useful as in a startup alias to load frequently used command 
lines from an easily altered file.  For example:

Alias: START

A15:
CLEDSYS                <- load SNAP image of ENV,TCAP,RCP,FCP,NDR,QUIET,&PATH
CLEDSAVE CLED.VAR L    <- load precomposed command lines into CLED
CLED                   <- turn the shell on
...                    <- rest of startup line runs before CLED gets control

For help with CLEDSAVE.COM, type "CLEDSAVE //".

     You may also use SNAP or NZBLITZ to save the system segment image with 
command lines already loaded (turn SAVE OFF first.)
