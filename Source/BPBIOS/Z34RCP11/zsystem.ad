Z System is first-rate, state-of-the-art software for your CP/M machine. 
ZCPR has been with us for over five years now, and has enhanced computer 
productivity for thousands of CP/M users.  Z System is now a mature 
replacement for CP/M 2.2 or CP/M Plus, yet is "backward compatible" with 
almost all programs written for CP/M.  This means that you can still run 
the CP/M programs you now use, yet take advantage of greatly increased 
power and performance at the same time.

NZ-COM and Z3PLUS form the heart of Z System.  They replace the most 
visible parts of CP/M 2.2 and CP/M Plus respectively, adding enhanced 
command processing, named directories, vastly improved resident 
commands, flow control processing, error handling, and much more.  But 
it isn't necessary to master all of these (at least at first!) to take 
advantage of NZ-COM and Z3PLUS.  In fact, though both packages come with 
several disks of software and excellent manuals, almost anyone can 
install either of these packages on their CP/M computer in just a few 
minutes' time.  The price for either NZ-COM or Z3PLUS is $69.95 plus $3 
shipping.

The next step up in sophistication for CP/M 2.2 users is ZSDOS.  ZSDOS 
replaces the less visible portion of CP/M 2.2 which controls program 
input and output.  Through clever coding and exhaustive testing, the 
authors of ZSDOS offer significant improvements in performance, safety, 
and versatility for CP/M 2.2, including file time and date stamping, 
file archiving for faster backups, public files (accessable from all 
user areas), path access to files, and improved error messages and 
handling.  As with NZ-COM and Z3PLUS, ZSDOS installation is completely 
menu-driven.  ZSDOS comes with a collection of state-of-the-art utility 
programs and a 140 page manual to help you make the most of the extended 
features.  ZSDOS costs $75 ($60 when purchased with NZ-COM) plus $3 
shipping.

Another path to system enhancement for CP/M 2.2 users with hard or RAM 
disks is available in the form of BackGrounder ii (BGii).  BGii allows 
you to "suspend" any program at the touch of a button and use a wide 
range of resident commands such as DIR, REN, ERA, CALC, or TYPE.  Then 
hit the button again and BGii quickly returns you to the program you 
suspended, right where you left off.  Or use BGii's SWAP command and 
you're back at the CP/M prompt, ready to run any other CP/M program.  
When you're through, SWAP again and BGii returns you to your original 
program, exactly as you left it!  Advanced "Cut" and "Paste" commands 
are also available for many terminals, allowing you to transfer sections 
of screen directly from one program to another.  Print spooling, 
advanced key redefinition and recording capabilities, and a beautifully 
designed 140-page user's manual are included.  Installation is 
menu-driven and easy.  BGii is compatible with either ZCPR or CP/M 2.2, 
and costs $75.00 plus $3 shipping.

Last but not least is DosDisk, a small but powerful program which allows 
you to read or write DIRECTLY to MS-DOS disks with your CP/M computer.  
No more file transfers--simply insert a standard MS-DOS DSDD diskette in 
your CP/M machine, type "DosDisk <drive>:", and away you go--all files 
on the diskette are now accessable by all of your CP/M programs--even 
files in MS-DOS subdirectories!  DosDisk comes with a handsome 38-page 
user's manual, and is available preconfigured for most machines at just 
$30.00 plus $3 shipping.  DosDisk is compatible with either ZCPR or 
CP/M 2.2.
