Overview of IF.COM

   IF  is the transient counterpart of the FCP-resident  IF  command.	IF.COM
tests the indicated condition to see if it is TRUE and,  if so,  sets the Flow
State to TRUE (allowing the following commands to execute).   If the condition
is  FALSE,  the  Flow  State is set to FALSE (allowing only Flow  Commands  to
execute).

   IF.COM is invoked if the current FCP has the IF.COM facility  enabled.   If
this is the case,  whenever an IF command is issued,  the FCP will load IF.COM
from  the  ROOT  directory into memory and execute it.	 The command  tail  is
passed to IF.COM, and IF.COM acts as a conventional COM file.

   Under  NZFCP  distributed  with NZ-COM and ZCPR vs.	3.4, IF.COM is invoked
only  if  the  indicated condition  is  NOT  included  in  the  condition  set
available  with  the  resident  FCP.   IF.COM may be invoked directly  if  its
invocation is preceeded by a colon, i.e. :IF .. etc.

   Syntax:  (1) IF ARG1=ARG2
	    (2) IF REGISTER# value
	    (3) IF CONDITION ARGUMENTS

   In form (1), the arguments are tested for literal equality and  must  match
character  for	character.   No space is permitted preceeding or following the
equal sign.  A more flexible comparison is provided by using form (3) with the
comparison  conditions,  i.e.	IF  EQ ARG1 ARG2 or IF = ARG1 ARG2.  This form
permits the use of the condition set EQ, NE, GT, GE, LT, LE as well  as  their
symbolic equivalents =, <> or ><, >, >=, <, <=.

   In all forms which permit or require the use of numeric values such as form
(2) or the VALUE and REG conditions, numeric entry may be specified as	octal,
binary or hexadecimal by appending the letters o, b or h to the number.

   In form (3), only the first two letters of the condition are signifigant.

   A '~' may be used to negate all conditions in forms (2) and (3).

  Options:

T	      - Flow State set to unconditionally to TRUE

F	      - Flow State set unconditionally to FALSEŠ
AMBIG fnme    - Flow state set TRUE if file name is ambiguous

ARCHIVE fnme  - Flow state set TRUE if archive attribute set

BG	      - Flow state set TRUE if BackGrounder present

COMPR fnme    - Flow state set TRUE if file is squeezed or Crunched

DS	      - Flow state set TRUE if DateStamper present

EMPTY afn,... - if any file in indicated list is EMPTY (size is 0k),
		Flow State is set to TRUE

ERROR [value] - if ZCPR3 error flag is set, Flow State is set to TRUE.	If
		value is present, flow state is set TRUE only if error
		number matches value.
Options (continued):

EXIST afn,... - if all files in the list exist, Flow State is set to TRUE

INPUT [text]  - user input is enabled, and if user strikes T, Y, <cr>, or
		<sp>, Flow State is set to TRUE.  Text appears as a prompt and
		may use '^' to generate control characters, %< to display
		upper case, %> to display lower case and ctl-a/ctl-b to
		enable/disable screen standout mode.

LIST tail     - Flow state set TRUE if tail contains items separated by commas

NULL afn      - if no 'afn' (field is blank), then Flow State is set to TRUE

PAUSE n [txt} -	Like INPUT above except that Flow State is automatically
		set to True if user does not respond within n seconds.

REG m op n    - Flow state set TRUE if expression is true.  M is a register
		number, n is a test value and op is a member of the operator
		set =, <>, ><, >, >=, <, <=.  All can be negated with '~'.

RO fnme       - Flow state set TRUE if file Read Only attribute set
Options (continued):

SHELL [name]  - Flow state set TRUE if a shell is on shell stack.  If name is
		present, it is compared to the name on the top of the shell
		stack and the flow state set TRUE if they match.  Name may
		ambiguous.

SYS fnme      - Flow state set TRUE if file Sys attribute set

TAG fnme n    - Flow state set TRUE if attribute n set in file name.

TCAP [string] - if a Z3TCAP is installed, Flow State is set to TRUE.  If
		string is present it is compared to the TCAP ID string (up
		to the length of the former) and the flow state set TRUE if
		they match.  String may contain '?' wildcards.

VALUE m op n  - Flow state set TRUE if expression is true.  M and n are values
		and op is an operater from the set =, <>, ><, >, >=, <, <=.
		All can be negated with '~'.

WHEEL	      - if WHEEL byte set, Flow State is set to TRUE
Options (continued):

ZEX	      - Flow state set TRUE if ZEX is running

reg# value    - if reg (0-31) has indicated value (0-255), Flow State is
		set to TRUE

afn1=afn2     - if two afns are identical in name, Flow State is set to TRUE

   A  leading  tilde  (~) char before a condition negates the  effect  of  the
condition.   If the condition is FALSE,  the Flow State is set to  TRUE.   For
each condition, only the first two chars are significant (eg. NU for NULL).

Examples:  "IF ~T" is the same as "IF F"
	   "IF ~NULL arg" is TRUE if 'arg' is non-blank
	   "IF ~EXIST afn,..." is TRUE if any 'afn' in the
		list does not exist.

Error Message:

IF.COM generates  several  error  messages  relating  to  improper  entry  of
condition  arguments.  These messages are self-explanatory.  See the help for
IF.COM Options for correct syntax for each condition.

The message 'IF overflow' indicates a nesting beyond the permitted 8 levels.

Examples of Use:

   a. IF NULL $1
      - if the indicated parameter (from within a SUBMIT or ZEX command file)
	is not provided, set the Flow State to TRUE

   b. IF ~EXIST ZEX.ASM,ZEX.ZEX
      - if any one of these files does not exist, Flow State is set to TRUE

   c. IF EXIST ZEX.ASM,ZEX.ZEX
      - if any one of these files does not exist, Flow State is set to FALSE
	(i.e., all files must exist for a TRUE Flow State)

   d. IF NEC=$1
      - if the first passed parameter is the same as the file name "NEC.",
	then the Flow State is Set to TRUE

   e. IF 5 7h
      - if Register 5 = 7 hexidecimal, the Flow State is Set to TRUE

Examples (continued):

   f. IF LT $1 FEE
      - if the first passed parameter preceeds 'FEE' in alphabetical order,
	the flow state is set to TRUE.
