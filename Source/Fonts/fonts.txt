Font files for ROMWBW.

There are three fonts associated with ROMWBW supported hardware - ECB-SCG, ECB-CVDU and the ECB-VGA3.

Name            Format      Size    Board & Display Mode

font8x8u.bin    8x8         2048    ECB-SCG, ECB-VGA3 (80x60)     
font8x11u.bin   8x11        2816    ECB-VGA3 (80x43)
font8x16u.bin   8x16        4096    ECB-CVDU (80x25), ECB-VGA3 (80x24, 80x25, 80x30)

For inclusion in HBIOS the .bin format files must be convert to assembler .asm format.
This is acheived using the fonttool utility and is completed automatically as part of the build process.
i.e. fonts files are converted to .asm format and then copied to the HBIOS directory. 

To replace a font, simply copy it to the Fonts directory using the same naming convention above, 
ensuring format and size match. Then complete a new build process.

To reduce the size of the HBIOS image, fonts can be compressed by using the USEZLSA2 equate.

Use the following in your custom configuration to turn on font compression:

USELZSA2	.SET	TRUE 

Compressed fonts are created using lzsa utility.

During the build process, fonts are compressed using the command line compressor by Emmanuel Marty
The compression is done as follows:

lzsa.exe -f2 -r <sourcefile> <outfile>

where option -f2 selects lzsa version 2 compression.
where option -r asks for the generation of raw (frame-less) data.
